              Betty Makena is among pio - neer women to break the glass ceiling
              by excelling in a perceived male doom - innate position. She is
              the first woman in Africa to be appointed a ship inspector by the
              International Transport Federation. She opened up to Anne Agwata,
              on her journey.
            </p>
            <p>
              MS Makena was born and raised in Mombasa County as the second born
              in a family of three boys and three girls. She is today a mother,
              a Docker, a trade unionist and a gender activist besides holding
              the coveted position in the International Transport Federation. We
              meet her at her office in the Mission to Seafarers building on the
              edge of Mombasa port.
            </p>
            <p>
              Her astute, resilient and determined demeanor are a true depiction
              of a woman with a golden heart and a sense of purpose. Her early
              life was not all rosy given that her mother, a primary school
              teacher was the sole breadwinner while her father was battling an
              addic - tion with the ‘bottle’. Due to the strain on the meagre
              salary that her mother earned, Betty and two of her, other
              siblings were sent to put up with their different relatives.
            </p>

            <p>
              “I was exhilarated to see that all these people had faith in me, enough to elect me to be their voice. I realised my duty to society and that I was born for a greater purpose. I vowed to let nothing and no one stand in my way of pursuing this noble course.” She adds: “I and nine other duly elected gender representatives from other districts met for a five-day train - ing at Tom Mboya Labour College in Kisumu. Of all the issues raised, gender based violence topped the list.” The COTU Women Committee then elected her as their chairperson for a five-year term. Betty went on to become an advocate for all young girls and women in the country on matters of gender based violence. While in this docket, Betty saw to the amendment of the COTU Con - stitution to allow women to sit in the organisation’s committee.

              She also fought for the appointment of more women in the trade union and alloca - tion of employment transfers, some - thing that most women would fight hard to get. In addition, she initiated the instal - lation of CCTV cameras in all offices at KPA, with the help of Jane Kamau who was then heading the Administration Department.

              As I stand out here in the wonders of the unknown at Hadley, I
              sort of realize there’s a fundamental truth to our nature, Man
              must explore, and this is exploration at its greatest.
